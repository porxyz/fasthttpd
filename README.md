fasthttpd is a web server and framework. It helps other developers write custom web apps in C++. 
The server is asynchronous, scalable, configurable and HTTPS is supported. 
There is a MYSQL API integrated in the sever for good performance, support for other databases is planned in the future. 
Currently HTTP 2.0 is not supported, but I'm working on it.
