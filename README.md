#### fasthttpd is a web server and framework. It helps other developers write custom web apps in C++. 
###### The server is asynchronous, scalable, configurable and HTTPS is supported. 
###### There is a MYSQL API integrated in the server for good performance, support for other databases is planned in the future. 
###### Currently HTTP 2.0 is not supported, but maybe it will in a future release.

#### Unfortunately, I do not have spare time to contribute anymore to this project.
#### If anyone is interested in further developing this project, please contact me.
